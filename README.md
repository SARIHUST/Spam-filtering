# Spam-filtering
This repository includes a minor E-mail database built on 650 E-mails collected from the Internet and from my high school classmates. 

I also put up 2 main python programs which will do the classification of the E-mails. The first program is based on a Naive Bayes classifier, and the second is based on K Nearest Neighbor classifier.
