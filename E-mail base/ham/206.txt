Is Plan 9 primarily intended as an operating system to do research on, or into?

Many of the postings on comp.os.research which run 'Plan 9 should have 
interesting feature x' seem to cast (recast?) Plan 9 as a operating system to
which exists for the purpose of investigating certain operating system ideas.
The impression I have from the Plan 9 literature so far seems to indicate that
the emphasis is more on creating a usable system, given certain ideas about
operating system design, namespaces and so on. I'm not asking whether Plan 9
is a pure research system or a pure production system - just which is considered
more important.
