A friend of mine tried this, writing to the lady as specified for universities
and explaining that he wanted it only for personal research, that he'd send
back his changes, etc.  He just heard back today after about two months.
The return letter told him that he couldn't have a license, but
thanking him for writing and saying that his letter and others like it
were helping to strengthen the position of a campaign to make Plan 9
available publically.

Therefore, I would strongly urge you to write.

OK,
John.
