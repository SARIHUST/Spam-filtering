if you want emacs, you can run it almost anywhere
else; why bother to run it here?

if you trust us enough to try our operating system,
why not trust us enough to try our other software,
like the window system and the editor?  why not see
if we have a good idea in our structuring of the
libraries and header files?  why marvel at the
compatibilities of the system when some of its
best ideas might be incompatibilities?  why install
a replica of your familiar playground with all these
new toys around?
