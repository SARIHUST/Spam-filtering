To shut down a terminal ctrl-t ctrl-t r.  This should be fine if it's
diskless.  If it isn't - no idea.  To cancell a process (delete or
numlock on some keyboard) will kill things in a window's process group.
This is in the 8.5 manual page.  To stop and resume text output: put
the window into non-scroll mode and use the page-down/VIEW key (again
check the manual pages like 8.5 and keyboard(6)), its altgraph on some
keyboard and the arrow keys on others.  This will scroll half a page.
Output is blocked while it can't be displayed, i.e., while it's off
the bottom of the page.
