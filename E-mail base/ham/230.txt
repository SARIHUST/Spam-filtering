Hi 9'ers,
does anyone have any examples of ALEF code they might
share? (Or know of an FTP site?) It needn't be all that 
complex, just something to demonstrate the concurrency 
primitives. I intend to write a simple demonstration 
program; like the "classic" dining philosophers.

Also, is SPARC and MIPS the only supported platforms?
Specifically, has anyone ported the compiler to the PC?

Any input is appreciated.
             Thanks in advance. --Jerry
