Hi 9`ers,
 could someone please expound on what is required to bring a machine
(sparc2, same as the fs) up as a cpu server the first time, 
other than changing the bootf, fs and auth variables in /lib/ndb/local
and loading 9sscpu? The system is up and running as term and fs, but 
what more is required to change the term to a cpu server? As well as 
detail what is required to then make this machine the authentication 
server, please?   Thanks in advance, --Jerry
