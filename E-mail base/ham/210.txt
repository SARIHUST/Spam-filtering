Okay, I've got some of the distribution problems sorted out.
9term, libXg, libframe, and libtext are now again available from
ftp.cs.su.oz.au:/matty/unicode.  I am waiting for a decision on the
font archive so the fonts are unavailable at the moment.  9term will
function with normal X fonts, however.

9x needs some tidying up so that should be back soon as well.

Thanks for everyone's interest and patience and my apologies to
those who've tried to ftp in the last half a week or so and have been
unable to.

					Matty.
