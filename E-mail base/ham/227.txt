 For those areas where there IS a definite hole (e.g.  news reader),
>writing new applications seems a much better idea...

I entirely agree with this: I detest all newsreaders: they are cramped,
monolithic pieces of cybercrud that make vms utilities look simple and
elegant.

There needs to be a better way to do news, both on an average un*x and
on plan 9.
