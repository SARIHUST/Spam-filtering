    
    In the good old days, copyright notices meant something.
    The latest instance of their devaluation is Matty's posting
    in a public place of a number of copyrighted fonts from
    the Plan 9 distribution (itself a violation of the copyright)
    without reproducing the notice (which would be our
    request to anyone who asked to copy them).
    
    For those interested in maintaining the principle of
    letting artists maintain ownership of their work, the
    fonts Matty distributed should be stored with the
    following notice:
    
    The fonts in this directory are based on fonts
    Copyright (c) 1985 Bigelow & Holmes Inc.
    
    This text is (with a substitution for (c)) the contents of
    /lib/font/bit/(pelm,lucm)/NOTICE
    
    -rob

Rob is of course right (he wins this week's award for the Most Public
Slap on the Wrist).  Ftp.cs.su.oz.au:/matty/unicode will be unavailable
until I sort things out.

For the record I do believe in copyright, the oversight has arisen from
the ad hoc way this distribution has grown rather than any malicious
or subversive intent on my part to deny authorship of the fonts.

					Matty.
