I should clarify this:  In Unix, most programs take standard input
and produce standard output.  The same is true in Plan 9.  So when
I said the plan 9 model is mostly the same, I was thinking of how
you run programs, not how you write them.  The incompatibilities
are a bit more dramatic from a programmer's point of view.
